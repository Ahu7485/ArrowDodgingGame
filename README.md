    [GitHub Pages](https://ailun-hu.github.io/Arrow-Game/)

## How To Play

    When Pressing the Start Button the Ball will spawn
    and Arrows will start spawning comming towards the ball
    Use Arrow Keys or W A S D to move the Circle and try to keep
    it alive for as long as possible avoiding all Arrows that 
    come towards it.

## How it Works
    
    The Game is done through a recursive funciton that is called
    as long as the there is no collision between player and obstacle.

    Frame Rate is limited to 60FPS due to some 
    hardware issues from Windows and Mac 
    that made he loop run faster for people with better hardware.

    However you can change the frames if in /Src/GameMechanics.js if prefered
